Along with this project, you have been attributed an Ubuntu server, living in a datacenter far far away. Like level 2 of the application process, you will connect using `ssh`. But contrary to level 2, you will not connect using a password but an RSA key. Weâ€™ve configured your server with the public key you created in the first task of a [previous project](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/UQIQV4HJGvBv0qrHhlDFaQ) shared in your [intranet](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/8ZlNV0J-sa-dijhmhJolOg) profile.

You can access your server information in the [my servers](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/e2_s_pXwBVuYbhrvoesfrg) section of the intranet, each line with contains the IP and username you should use to connect via ssh.

**Note**: Your server is configured with an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment.
