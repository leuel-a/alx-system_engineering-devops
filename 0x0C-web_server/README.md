# Web Server

In this project, I will be configuring my **NGINX** web server. A *web server* is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users.

This project will be graded baed on two aspects:
1. Is your web-01 server configured according to requirements
2. Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (meaning without any human intervention)

A good Software Engineer is a [lazy Software Engineer](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/sRY__axKNHhNW0SVmsUC_A).
