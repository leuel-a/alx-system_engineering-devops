# API

An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact. REST is an acronym for Representational State Transfer â€” an almost meaningless description of the most-used web service technology! A REST API is a way for two computer systems to communicate using the HTTP technologies found in web browsers and servers.
